# 📧 Email Spam Classification App

This project is a simple yet effective **Spam Detection Web App** built using **Streamlit**, **Scikit-learn**, and **NLTK**. It allows users to input email content and classify it as either **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using a trained Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Real-time email classification
- 🧠 Pre-trained SVC model with TF-IDF vectorization
- 🧹 Text preprocessing using NLTK (tokenization, stopword removal)
- 📊 Future support for visualizations (e.g., word clouds, spam trends)
